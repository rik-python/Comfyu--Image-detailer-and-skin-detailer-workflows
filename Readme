Flux DyPE + SRPO Skin Detailer — ComfyUI Workflow Pack

Youtube link - https://youtu.be/BUVC-zu8OWk

This repository contains two high-quality, production-tested ComfyUI workflows designed for realistic image enhancement, micro-detail restoration, and photographic skin detailing without introducing plastic shine or crunchy artifacts.

These workflows focus on handling the two areas where AI images often fall apart:

Fine surface texture (fabric, hair, stone, metal, natural microdetail)

Realistic human skin (pores, softness, breakup, natural imperfections)

Flux DyPE and SRPO excel in their own domains — together they form a powerful, VFX-grade detail enhancement toolkit.

🔥 Workflows Included
1. Flux DyPE + Upscale — Detail Enhancement Workflow

A detail-focused workflow using Flux DyPE to enhance:

microtexture

surface breakup

fine edges

natural photographic detail

Flux DyPE adds believable enhancement without hallucinating random shapes or “over-texturing” the image. It is ideal for:

landscapes

architecture

clothing fabrics

hair strands

props and surfaces

general AI images that feel too soft

Output quality: 2K / 4K / 8K (tile-friendly)
Best for: Extra realism and depth without losing the original image identity.

2. SRPO Skin Detailer + Upscale — Realistic Skin Workflow

SRPO is one of the most accurate models for human skin reconstruction.
This workflow enhances:

pores

micro-breakup

real skin texture

soft falloff

natural imperfections

Without making the face look:

plastic

waxy

over-sharpened

overly smoothed

Perfect for:

portraits

model shots

beauty work

close-ups

any image where skin realism matters

Output quality: 2K / 4K / 8K
Best for: High-end skin enhancement with the most natural, non-AI look.

🎯 Why These Two Models?

Different AI upscalers/models excel at different tasks:

Flux DyPE = best for overall microdetail

SRPO = best for skin textures and facial realism

Trying to use one model for everything often leads to poor results.
These two specialized workflows give you the best outcome for their specific categories.

⚙️ Recommended Settings
Flux DyPE

Denoise: 0.20–0.35

Tile size: 1024–1536

Best after a light pre-upscale or SDXL refinement

SRPO Skin Detailer

Denoise: 0.10–0.20

Avoid over-sharpening

Use mask control for selective skin detail

📌 Notes for Best Results

Don’t apply both models to the entire image at once.

For portraits:

Use SRPO for skin

Use Flux DyPE for clothing, hair, background

Keep sharpening subtle — realism comes from balance, not maximum sharpness.

Avoid 8x upscales in a single pass. Use 2x or 4x chained for stability.
